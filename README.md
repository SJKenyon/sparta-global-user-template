# User Controller (ruby lab)

## Creation

I created this ruby project without using the scaffolding command in the terminal. It uses a database to make and store user profiles by connecting the controller and view pages in the post folder.

The user needs to have:
- Email
- First Name
- Last Name
- Age

You can edit the users once they have been created and see a list of all users.

### Cloning

You will need ruby (v 2.5.1) for this calculator to work.

You will also need to run the command:
```
bundle
```
or
```
bundle install
```
to use the gems I have in this project.

You will then need to create a database to hold your users on by running:
```
rails db:create
```
